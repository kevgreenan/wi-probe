# Wi-probe
An SSID finding tool

## How do I use it?
Easy!  Just download all of the files to a directory, then open a terminal and run `wi-probe.py` to display the help page.  In order for it to work, you will need to modify `wi-probe.conf` with your own API keys for WiGLE, Google Maps, and Shodan.  By default, Wigle only allows 10 queries per day.
